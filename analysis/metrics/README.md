# Evaluation Metrics

This folder contains code to compute evaluation metrics on LLM360 models.

In particular, see the following two subfolders:
- [`harness/`](harness/) provides instructions to evaluate models following the [Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard).
- [`ppl/`](ppl/) evaluates model per-token perplexity

## Our Approach

We provide implementations of evaluations on a variety of benchmarks, including the conventional benchmarks like MMLU, Hellaswag, ARC, user-preference aligned benchmarks like MT-bench, long-context evaluations like LongEval, and additional studies on safety benchmarks for truthfulness, toxicity, and bias. Moreover, we report results on the model samples we preselected from a suite of LLMs where they are all trained on same data seen in the exact same order to better observe and understand how our models develop and evolve over the training process. We also provide public access to all checkpoints, all code and all wandb dashboards for detailed training and evaluation curves.

## List of Analysis and Metrics

Below is a list of the main evaluation metrics we use, primarily implemented in the [`harness/`](harness/) subfolder. For each model we release, we include the links to specific wandb reports if the evaluation is done. Please refer to model cards ([Amber](https://huggingface.co/LLM360/Amber), [Crystal](https://huggingface.co/LLM360/CrystalCoder)) for any terms or definitions. Please stay tuned on the upcoming changes!
